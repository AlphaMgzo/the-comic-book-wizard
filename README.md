the-comic-book-wizard
=====================
The comic book wizard allows you to select a directory containing images or any files in the folder. It then lists them along with the total size of all the files selected. On the right side you can preview each image by clicking on it in the list or double clicking to open the actual file. If you want to remove a file select it in the list and click delete. 

After you are happy with the files in the list you then have the option of either compressing all the files that are listed into a ZIP or CBZ or both and compress and save them do a directory. You can also leave both check boxes checked and it will compress and save both a ZIP and a CBZ.

Requirements: 
*NetFramework 4.5
*x86(32 bit) or 64 bit processor




Future updates/features:
*selection of cover image for CBZ compression
*checking cover image to make sure its compatible with portable devices
*allowing users to select a compression ratio which requires a different library
*handle .RAR & CBR files (open only)
*combine multiple CBZ files and combine them into a single CBZ file with files in order
*possibly convert PDF to CBZ
*preview output
*open archives within the program
*lower NetFramework version Requirements
*possible port to other operating systems
*optimization of the code & possible inclusion of C++ libraries to speed things up
