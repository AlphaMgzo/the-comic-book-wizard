The Comic Book Wizard
=====================
The comic book wizard allows you to select a directory containing images or any files in the folder. It then lists them along with the total size of all the files selected. On the right side you can preview each image by clicking on it in the list or double clicking to open the actual file. If you want to remove a file select it in the list and click delete. 

After you are happy with the files in the list you then have the option of either compressing all the files that are listed into a ZIP or CBZ or both and compress and save them do a directory. You can also leave both check boxes checked and it will compress and save both a ZIP and a CBZ. Future updates will allow opening CBR & RAR and various other features.

Requirements:
